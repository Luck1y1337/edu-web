## API Integration

The frontend communicates with a NestJS REST API featuring:

- **JWT Authentication** — access + refresh token flow with automatic renewal on 401
- **Role-based Access** — `student`, `instructor`, `admin`, `super_admin`
- **Strict Validation** — backend enforces query parameter whitelist (no unknown params)
- **Paginated Responses** — standardized `{ items, total, page, limit, totalPages }` format

All API calls are centralized in `services/api.ts` with typed request/response interfaces derived from the Swagger specification.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The project includes a `vercel.json` with:
- **API proxy** — rewrites `/api/*` to the backend, solving HTTPS mixed-content issues
- **SPA fallback** — all routes serve `index.html` for client-side routing

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Set the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable to `/api/v1` in your Vercel project settings.

### Static Export

```bash
yarn build
# Serve the dist/ directory with any static file server
# Ensure all routes fallback to index.html
```

## Security

- **No secrets in the repository** — the only runtime configuration is `VITE_BACKEND_URL`, supplied via an untracked `.env` file. `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` documents the expected variables.
- **Authentication** — JWT access/refresh flow; the access token is attached via an Axios request interceptor and cleared on logout or 401.
- **Route guards** — `ProtectedRoute` and `AdminRoute` gate authenticated and admin-only areas; access is always re-validated by the backend.
- **XSS protection** — all user- and API-supplied HTML (blog content, rich text) is sanitized with DOMPurify before rendering.
- **Input validation** — every form is validated client-side with Zod schemas; the backend enforces its own validation and a strict query-parameter whitelist.

> **Note:** `VITE_*` variables are inlined into the client bundle at build time and are therefore public by design. Never place private secrets (API keys, database credentials) in a `VITE_`-prefixed variable.
